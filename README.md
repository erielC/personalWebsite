Official Personal Website for Presenting Myself

[10.21.24] I haven't really focused too much on web-development as I am occupied with schoolwork and other things. However, I do want to design a basic personal website with not too much emphasis on design rather so much on the content and the things that I want to add there. For now it will have a similiar structure to a LateX document but in the forseeable future I will implement modern tools around Feburary 2025.
