                Hello! My name is Eriel Cabrera. I am currently studying
                Computer Engineering @ (FIU) Florida International University.
                Some of my areas of interest include aerospace, computer
                technology software/hardware, quantum computing, artificial
                intelligence, web development, mathematics, and reading. As of
                [10.21.24] I am heavily involved in a rocketry club where I am
                part of the avionics team resposible for developing a flight
                computer. I have never worked with complicated
                software/hardware, let alone electronics but I am extremely
                excited to embark on this new journey. Some areas of work that I
                am collaborating with other engineers are: PCB design said
                computer and writing the software for operation during flight.
                Other development experiences I had was a 36-hour hackathon
                hosted by INIT FIU, my team and I identified a common issue
                among FIU studentsâ€”finding the best spots to study or grab a
                cafecito near campus. To address this, we developed a web
                platform where students can discover and review local cafes and
                study spots within an 8-mile radius of FIU. As the lead backend
                developer, I implemented user authentication with JavaScript and
                MongoDB, ensuring only verified FIU students could post reviews,
                and assisted with designing the database structure to manage
                user data and reviews efficiently. I also contributed to the
                front-end using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive user
                experience for browsing and reviewing locations. This project
                provided a community-driven solution and demonstrated my skills
                in both full-stack development.
