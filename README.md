Official Personal Website for Presenting Myself

[10.21.24] I haven't really focused too much on web-development as I am occupied with schoolwork and other things. However, I do want to design a basic personal website with not too much emphasis on design rather so much on the content and the things that I want to add there. For now it will have a similiar structure to a LateX document but in the forseeable future I will implement modern tools around Feburary 2025. 

**Feautres Added** 
- Homepage (ensured scalability & mobile use)
- Custom Domain & Uploaded to Github Pages

**FUTURE Tasks TBD**
- Update Pages: Course Work, Project & Clubs, Tools & Software
- Ensure seamless mobile use
- Add light/dark feature to change color of content on website
